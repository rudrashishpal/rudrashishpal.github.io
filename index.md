  Hey there! Welcome to webpage. I am Rudrashish Pal. An electrical engineer by profession, I graduated from the <a href="https://iitbhilai.ac.in/">Indian Institute of Technology Bhilai</a> in May 2020. In general I am interested in how "things" work and have worked on/interested in a wide range of "things". Currently I am interested in circuit modelling and microelectronics (special focus on Analog VLSI).
</p>
<p>
Apart from the usual boring stuff, I listen to music, watch movies/series and scroll through memes. I especially enjoy standup/sketch comedy. Occasionally you may find me cooking, singing or playing the guitar. I would like to mention I am not very keen on sports/games in general.
</p>
<p>
Catch me below. Let's grab a cup of coffee (or tea perhaps?)
